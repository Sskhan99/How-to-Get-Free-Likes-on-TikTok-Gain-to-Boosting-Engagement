Using bots or fake accounts to generate likes violates TikTok’s terms of service. This could lead to your account being shadowbanned or permanently suspended.

Fake likes don’t translate into meaningful engagement, such as comments, shares, or followers.


3. Reputation Damage
Brands and viewers can easily identify fake engagement, which could harm your credibility.
